The system gives a 404 error.\r\n\r\n### Issues\r\n#### Serving mp3 files\r\n\r\nIn the web.config file there is a list of handlers by extension. Unfortunately this is a static list, Asp.Net does not allow us to provide this list dynamically, so we have to add new lines manually. Look for the line defined for mp4 files (mp4Handler), make a copy of that line and define a similar line for mp3 files. The goal is to let the system know that these files should be handled by our _static file handler_ that is able to serve files from the repository.\r\n\r\n#### File content type (MIME type)\r\n\r\nWhen you upload a file, we try to determine its content type – currently by its extension. This is managed by the _MimeTable.GetMimeType_ method in the Storage project. We have a static, hardcoded **mime table** that actually contains mp3, but with **multiple content types**. We return **only the first one**, which is video/mpeg (instead of audio). This is incorrect, but we have to check why this value is in that list. The result is that when you download the file (after you completed the previous config fix), you get a file with an mpeg extension.\r\n\r\n#### Re-upload files\r\nAfter the fixes above, existing mp3 files have to be refreshed so that their content type is refreshed in the db.\r\n\r\n- [ ] backport to SN6 if possible and notify AV\r\n- [ ] patch? (change saved content type in db)",
